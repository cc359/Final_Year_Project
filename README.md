# Final_Year_Project_Samples
A small sample of the code produce by myself to contribute to the Dark Energy Survey, with the aim of using it to aid in the production of images to be used in an analysis pipeline to help find potential candidates for Planet Nine. 
Also included is my dissertation that acts as documentation for undergraduates who may need to edit or build upon this codebase for future work, 
keeping in mind that they might not be completely confident with the basic programming techniques I have used.

# get_single_epoch_v2.py 

This script is used to pull the required data given a list of parameters from the DES database in tandem with their Python API "EasyAccess". Furthermore MySQL queries were required in order to find the correct tables within the larger DES database to pull information from. These are mentioned in the Dissertation.pdf documentation.

# html_s_epoch.py
This very simple script was used to generate web pages of the final images to be analysed, the main purpose of this was to be able to present the image data to other members of the DES collaboration in a very simple manner.
