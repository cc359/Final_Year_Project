# Final_Year_Project_Samples
A small sample of the code produce by myself to contribute to the Dark Energy Survey, with the aim of using it to aid in the production of images to be used in an analysis pipeline to help find potential candidates for Planet Nine. 
Also included is my dissertation that acts as documentation for undergraduates who may need to edit or build upon this codebase for future work, 
keeping in mind that they might not be completely confident with the basic programming techniques I have used.
